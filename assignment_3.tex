\begin{homeworkProblem}

    a) Summarize the encryption techniques(DES and RSA) with emphasis on their advantages and disadvantages. \\

    \begin{quoting}

        DES and RSA take two fundamentally approaches when it comes to trying
        to encrypt a given message. Both have their advantages and
        disadvantages in different situations. \\

        DES is a block cipher, meaning it will accept blocks of plain text and
        output a block of cipher text. DES takes in 64 bit blocks and outputs
        an equivalent 64 bit block of cipher text. A typical key is also 64
        bits in size however only 56 bits of that is the actual key with 8
        being reserved for parity. This key is used on both the encryption and
        decryption process meaning DES is a symmetric encryption algorithm.
        During the encryption process the algorithm will perform 16 rounds of
        the Feistel function. The Feistel function accepts a half block and a
        subkey. The subkey is generated specifically for that round of the
        function. With these two it will perform a couple operations, an
        expansion, XOR, substitution and finally permutation.  All of these
        operations are rudimentary thus making DES a very fast encryption
        algorithm. \\

        RSA on the other hand is an asymmetric encryption algorithm meaning the
        keys used for encryption and decryption are different. To do this a
        key pair must be generated. A key pair is required for each party
        wishing to communicate and contains a public and a private key. The
        public key can be shared with the world while the private key must
        remain a secret. To send encrypt a message to someone you must encrypt
        the message you wish to send with the persons public key. The encrypted
        message can only be decrypted by the corresponding private key. The
        encryption algorithm use modular exponentiation of messages/keys in
        numeric form. These calculations can end up being very large with a
        typical key size today being 2048 bit. The calculations can be broken
        down into smaller pieces using modular arithmetic but the result of
        this is a very slow algorithm. The size of the message we can encrypt
        is at most the size of the key pair used. \\

        When comparing the two algorithms it's very clear to see the key size
        between the two is significantly different. DES only uses 56 bits
        compared to RSA which \textit{generally} uses 2048 bit. Obviously the
        larger the keysize the better in terms of how cryptographically secure
        the algorithm is. Currently it is considered impossible to crack RSA
        encryption using a keysize of 2048 bit using the computing power
        available however it's relatively trivial to crack a 56 bit DES
        encryption. Today DES is used in a form called triple DES where the
        plain text is encrypted three times with different keys each time, this
        is considered to be reasonably secure today. RSA has the obvious
        advantage over DES when it comes to the cryptographic security of the
        encrypted messages. \\
        
        As technology and techniques for breaking keys improves keysizes will
        eventually become insecure. Considering the abundance of cheap hard
        drive space today it's not expensive for an attacker to simply save
        your encrypted messages today and either spend a long time cracking the
        key (3DES) or wait for technology to reach a stage where that keysize
        is no longer secure (RSA). It's easy to conclude that the messages we
        encrypt today will not be secure forever. One advantage RSA has of
        DES/3DES is how easy it is to increase the key size, it's simply a
        matter of increasing the size of the primes you select. The larger the
        keysize you select the longer you can expect your messages to be
        secure. \\

        When trying to encrypt larger messages with DES we are able to break
        the message up into smaller 64 bit blocks and encrypt each separately.
        RSA will encrypt the entire message in one hit and can encrypt messages
        with a size as large as the keysize. Using the typical keysize of 2048
        we can in the best case encrypt 256 chars (\textit{This isn't possible
        given the way a message is structured, padding/random bits.}). These
        sizes are impractical when encrypting words as we can only really
        encrypt a paragraph or so. File encryption with RSA is practically out
        of the question. DES has the advantage of being able to encrypt files
        of any size. \\

        In public key encryption the public key is know by everyone. Because of
        this a potential attacker can encrypt messages using the publicly known
        key they can generate messages that they would expect to see and
        compare the cipher text they generate with what they are seeing over
        the network. To combat this we have to generate a random component to
        the message as well as pad the message out. DES has the advantage over
        RSA of as the key is only known by the two parties communicating,
        and because of this attackers cannot generate cipher texts with the
        key. \\

        Because DES is a symmetric encryption algorithm the same key is
        required on both sides to communicate. Somehow the two parties need to
        share the key with each other, often it's not possible to meet up to
        exchange the key every time we need one, thus we have to transmit it
        over the network. We must ensure the key is remains a secret, if it is
        revealed it would be trivial for an attacker to read all communications
        for the duration of that key. Because of the size of the internet and
        the shear number of different people we need to communicate with
        securely we simply cannot have a secure channel for each. RSA on the
        other hand simply requires a exchange of keys once, the keypair can be
        used for many years without any major security issue, once a keypair
        has been used it can be used to sign the new public key proving to
        everyone you had already shared with that you are still who you say you
        are. Ignoring \textit{Diffie Hellman} key exchange for the time being
        we can see that RSA has a massive advantage in terms of key exchange
        over DES.
